### STEWARD-FIELD - where a package records who looks after it

**Context:** The assignment needs a committed home that names a work, never a host or session. The brief proposed a new `state.md` field, `steward: self` or `steward: work/<sop id>`. Both reviews reject `self`, which is not a holder value, and both reject reading the assignment as the holder. The Claude review would reuse `work.md`'s existing `worker` field: `worker: work/va` when the State of play looks after the package, and `agent` when the Project's own thread does. That adds no field and leaves the closed field set unchanged. Stewardship changes only when Kris opens or closes a thread, the slow rate `work.md` suits, and the holder stays derived from `state` and `worker` as today. The Codex review wants a dedicated assignment with its own vocabulary, distinct from holder and session, and leaves the exact field to the design. A separate field keeps the assignment visible beside the state, and it avoids a third sense of "steward" only if it is named with care.

**Query:** Should the assignment be recorded in a new dedicated field rather than `work.md`'s existing `worker` field?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; the Codex review and a masked blind review on Codex want a dedicated field, as lasting responsibility should not share a field with the holder that pick-up reads, while the Claude review prefers reusing `worker` as it adds no field) A new dedicated field, taking `work/<id>` values only, never `self`, changed or removed as part of the acknowledged handover.

b) Reuse `work.md`'s `worker`: `worker: work/<sop id>` while the State of play looks after the package, `agent` while its own thread does.

### LEGACY-PREFIX - how a `repo_code` rename passes the streams and roadmap audits

**Context:** the `ki-repo-kb-streams` streams audit and `ki-work-roadmap`'s checks fail every record not prefixed with the current `repo_code`. A rename therefore has to happen in one sweep, or the repository fails its audit until every record has moved. Personal is renaming KB to PERSONAL that way now. An allowance, an optional list of former codes that existing records may keep while new records take the new code, would allow a gradual path. It would need both checkers and the tools-ki readers to change.

**Query:** Should a `repo_code` rename stay a one-sweep change, written into `ki-work-roadmap`, rather than gaining a legacy-prefix allowance?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would add the former-code list, since issued identifiers are cited outside the repository and a sweep breaks those links, while renames are rare and Personal's runs as one sweep, so documenting the sweep costs one paragraph where the allowance costs two checkers and tools-ki) Write the rename into `ki-work-roadmap` as one sweep: every record and in-repository reference in one commit, pruned links keeping their pinned revisions.

b) Add an optional legacy-prefix list accepted by both audits for existing records only, with new records required to use the current code.

### PARTIAL-REPOS - how a repository with only Pillars and Resources fits the model

**Context:** HNR keeps hnr-shared, which holds only Pillars and Resources, beside hnr-principal. ZONE-1 requires all five zones, and the registry binds one source store per declared repository, so hnr-shared cannot be declared. Its store is written up only in tracked notes, so `ki repo store` and the source audits do not see it. Kris asked Knowledge Islands to decide where partial repositories fit, and whether a person keeps a personal "work" knowledge base beside a person-agnostic company Capital, adding: "there's [a] kind [of] weird thing here we maybe need to come back to." The question reaches the Structure note, `ki-repo-kb` and tools-ki, beyond this work's method scope.

**Query:** Should PARTIAL-REPOS wait as an idea until Kris opens it, rather than starting a design now?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would start the design now, as your explicit question and the store-audit gap justify a bounded look, while your own words defer it, and nothing is broken beyond HNR's tracked-notes workaround) Record it as an idea on the Ways of working Project note with the HNR evidence linked, and start a `ki-work-design` brief when Kris opens it.

b) Start a `ki-work-design` brief now covering partial repositories, the personal "work" knowledge base and the store-binding gap.

### UNATTENDED-FIELD - recording unattended eligibility on records

**Context:** Personal's prototype assessed 76 records against eight ordered criteria, 9 eligible, 21 near-miss and 46 attended, and proposed a record field. The brief proposes an optional `unattended` mapping in `ki-work-roadmap` with `verdict` (`eligible`, `near-miss`, `attended`), `criterion`, `question` and `assessed`, an absent mapping read as attended, and the criteria owned by `ki-delegation`.

**Query:** Should records carry this optional `unattended` mapping, with the eight criteria in `ki-delegation`?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would keep the assessment in a per-window note with no record field, as eligibility depends on the grant and can go stale, and review the eight criteria before standardising them, while Personal's assessment shows the criteria sort real records, and a field spares rereading every record at each window) Adopt the mapping and the criteria, refreshed at each status or horizon change.

b) Keep the assessment in a per-window note, with no record field.

### BOOT-HOME - Who owns the bootstrap from a fresh machine to a working coordinator

**Context:** `ki-bootstrap` covers the harness and skill activation and then stops; `ki-coordination` starts at the opener. Between them, chezmoi's hook and style binding, the Capital's declarations, `ki skill add ki-work-design`, the readiness checks and `ki agent prompts` with `claude --name` are written nowhere as one path, so a fresh machine can fail silently at the hook or the style. Kris's goal is that "when we do a bootstrap ... it works really well".

**Query:** Which skill holds the one bootstrap checklist?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence high - reviewed; a masked blind review on Codex agreed, as it follows the existing ownership boundary and gives silent activation failures one accountable home) `ki-bootstrap` owns the one machine-readiness checklist, ending with a "Ready to coordinate" result and observable checks that the hook and output style actually work; `ki-coordination`'s Bootstrap gains a "Before the opener" step that cites it and keeps the session half; a `ki doctor` check in `tools-ki` backs it later, and readiness never depends on it before it exists.

b) `ki-coordination` owns the whole path, machine half included, and `ki-bootstrap` links to it

c) a guide in ki-principal under `Pillars/` owns the narrative, and both skills link to it

### TRADES-FATE - What becomes of ki-trades now its hold is overdue

**Context:** `ki-trades` is on hold with a review due by 21 October 2026, now four days past, and its `HOLD-1` audit item warns. Existing trades keep full support. HANDOFF-AS-MESSAGE moved handoffs and rollouts to `messages.md`, so it now governs only the trade routes `.ki.toml` declares. The planned Trades revamp Project's outcome, a succinct trade policy granting the same as now, is that narrower job.

**Query:** Should `ki-trades` be narrowed now or kept on hold?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence high - reviewed; a masked blind review on Codex agreed that a bounded clarification aligns the skill with the message contract without granting new authority) Narrow `ki-trades` now to the routes the Capital's declared trade policy grants, with a pointer to `messages.md` for handoffs and rollouts; keep full support for existing trades and the ban on new submissions; make opening the Trades revamp the next review trigger, with a finite calendar backstop kept on HOLD-1.

b) keep it on hold with a new review date, untouched until the Trades revamp opens

### RECAP-NAME - What ki-recap's checkpoint argument is called

**Context:** `ki-recap` offers `checkpoint <thread>`, which composes `ki-work-package` UPDATE. "Thread" now means a session acting on work, and the argument is really a work id. The three recap forms (one session, one work since its mark, the unattended window's return) otherwise have clean scopes.

**Query:** Should the argument become `checkpoint <work id>`?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence high - the model made work the unit and the argument already resolves an id) rename it to `checkpoint <work id>`, accepting the old word through the tolerance window

b) keep `checkpoint <thread>` and define it in the Glossary as the work the thread carries

### CLI-PREVIEW - How public commands that change state offer a preview

**Context:** You settled that `mgit repair` writes by default, and on 24 October left the wider convention open. Today the two harness standards for tools ([tool repositories](/Users/krisbrown/workspaces/knowledge-islands/ki-agentic-harness/skills/repo-structure/ki-repo-tools/references/standards-tool-repositories.md) and [CLI conventions](/Users/krisbrown/workspaces/knowledge-islands/ki-agentic-harness/skills/repo-structure/ki-repo-tools/references/standards-cli-conventions.md)) still require a preview step before a repair writes, contradicting that decision. `mgit repair`, `ki repo repair` and `ki repo conform` already act by default; `ki repair` and Almanac repair keep preview gates. Some writes must keep their safeguards: Rig remove (deletes data), Rig repair (a reviewed proposal file), firewall and service changes, and remote host removal. The command inventory is retained in [wow-dryrun-survey.report.md](/Users/krisbrown/workspaces/knowledge-islands/ki-principal/+/_WORK/ki.ways-of-working/wow-dryrun-survey.report.md).

**Query:** Should public commands that change owned state write by default and offer `--dry-run`/`-n` as the preview, with both standards reconciled now and each tool changed later through its own work?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviewed; a masked blind review on Codex recommended it, keeping medium because your decision settled `mgit` only, not every shipped command) Write by default; `--dry-run` and `-n` show the same changes without applying them, and must prevent local and provider changes, not just the final write; `--check` is a read-only verification that fails on findings; `--apply`, `--write` and `--fix` are not routine write gates, and `--yes` only confirms. Keep named, documented exceptions for data deletion, publication, reviewed proposals and connection-critical changes. Reconcile both standards first, then change each tool through its owning work, with no fleet-wide flag migration.

b) Keep the current convention with `mgit repair` as the one exception, and hold the survey for a later decision.
