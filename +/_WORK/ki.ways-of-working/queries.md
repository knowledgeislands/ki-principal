### STEWARD-FIELD - where a package records who looks after it

**Context:** The assignment needs a committed home that names a work, never a host or session. The brief proposed a new `state.md` field, `steward: self` or `steward: work/<sop id>`. Both reviews reject `self`, which is not a holder value, and both reject reading the assignment as the holder. The Claude review would reuse `work.md`'s existing `worker` field: `worker: work/va` when the State of play looks after the package, and `agent` when the Project's own thread does. That adds no field and leaves the closed field set unchanged. Stewardship changes only when Kris opens or closes a thread, the slow rate `work.md` suits, and the holder stays derived from `state` and `worker` as today. The Codex review wants a dedicated assignment with its own vocabulary, distinct from holder and session, and leaves the exact field to the design. A separate field keeps the assignment visible beside the state, and it avoids a third sense of "steward" only if it is named with care.

**Query:** Should the assignment be recorded in a new dedicated field rather than `work.md`'s existing `worker` field?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; the Codex review and a masked blind review on Codex want a dedicated field, as lasting responsibility should not share a field with the holder that pick-up reads, while the Claude review prefers reusing `worker` as it adds no field) A new dedicated field, taking `work/<id>` values only, never `self`, changed or removed as part of the acknowledged handover.

b) Reuse `work.md`'s `worker`: `worker: work/<sop id>` while the State of play looks after the package, `agent` while its own thread does.

### LEGACY-PREFIX - how a `repo_code` rename passes the streams and roadmap audits

**Context:** the `ki-repo-kb-streams` streams audit and `ki-work-roadmap`'s checks fail every record not prefixed with the current `repo_code`. A rename therefore has to happen in one sweep, or the repository fails its audit until every record has moved. Personal is renaming KB to PERSONAL that way now. An allowance, an optional list of former codes that existing records may keep while new records take the new code, would allow a gradual path. It would need both checkers and the tools-ki readers to change.

**Query:** Should a `repo_code` rename stay a one-sweep change, written into `ki-work-roadmap`, rather than gaining a legacy-prefix allowance?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would add the former-code list, since issued identifiers are cited outside the repository and a sweep breaks those links, while renames are rare and Personal's runs as one sweep, so documenting the sweep costs one paragraph where the allowance costs two checkers and tools-ki) Write the rename into `ki-work-roadmap` as one sweep: every record and in-repository reference in one commit, pruned links keeping their pinned revisions.

b) Add an optional legacy-prefix list accepted by both audits for existing records only, with new records required to use the current code.

### PARTIAL-REPOS - how a repository with only Pillars and Resources fits the model

**Context:** HNR keeps hnr-shared, which holds only Pillars and Resources, beside hnr-principal. ZONE-1 requires all five zones, and the registry binds one source store per declared repository, so hnr-shared cannot be declared. Its store is written up only in tracked notes, so `ki repo store` and the source audits do not see it. Kris asked Knowledge Islands to decide where partial repositories fit, and whether a person keeps a personal "work" knowledge base beside a person-agnostic company Capital, adding: "there's [a] kind [of] weird thing here we maybe need to come back to." The question reaches the Structure note, `ki-repo-kb` and tools-ki, beyond this work's method scope.

**Query:** Should PARTIAL-REPOS wait as an idea until Kris opens it, rather than starting a design now?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would start the design now, as your explicit question and the store-audit gap justify a bounded look, while your own words defer it, and nothing is broken beyond HNR's tracked-notes workaround) Record it as an idea on the Ways of working Project note with the HNR evidence linked, and start a `ki-work-design` brief when Kris opens it.

b) Start a `ki-work-design` brief now covering partial repositories, the personal "work" knowledge base and the store-binding gap.

### UNATTENDED-FIELD - recording unattended eligibility on records

**Context:** Personal's prototype assessed 76 records against eight ordered criteria, 9 eligible, 21 near-miss and 46 attended, and proposed a record field. The brief proposes an optional `unattended` mapping in `ki-work-roadmap` with `verdict` (`eligible`, `near-miss`, `attended`), `criterion`, `question` and `assessed`, an absent mapping read as attended, and the criteria owned by `ki-delegation`.

**Query:** Should records carry this optional `unattended` mapping, with the eight criteria in `ki-delegation`?

**Options:**

a) (recommended, confidence medium - reviews disagree; a masked blind review on Codex would keep the assessment in a per-window note with no record field, as eligibility depends on the grant and can go stale, and review the eight criteria before standardising them, while Personal's assessment shows the criteria sort real records, and a field spares rereading every record at each window) Adopt the mapping and the criteria, refreshed at each status or horizon change.

b) Keep the assessment in a per-window note, with no record field.
